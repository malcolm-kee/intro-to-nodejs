## Installation

For unix/MacOS/Windows WSL users, install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

For Windows users, install [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Once you complete the installation steps, verify the installation by running the following in your terminal:

```bash
nvm -v
```

which should shows you the version of NVM.

Then, run

```bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

which should update your Node.js version to 16.

Verify everything works with

```bash
node -v
```

which should shows you something like 

```bash
v16.13.1
```
